# Two-stage-OTA
This project involves the hand-design, simulation, and analysis of a two-stage OTA using CMOS technology. It was developed as part of a classroom assignment for the Analog Circuits course at IIT Guwahati, with specifications requiring a DC gain ≥ 40 dB and implementation of a non-inverting amplifier with gain = 2.  
## OBJECTIVE:
*To design a two-stage operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) in TSMC180nm CMOS technology.

*Ensure a minimum DC gain of 40 dB.

*Use the OTA in a non-inverting amplifier configuration with closed-loop gain = 2.
