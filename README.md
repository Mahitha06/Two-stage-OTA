# Two-stage-OTA
This project involves the hand-design, simulation, and analysis of a two-stage OTA using CMOS technology. It was developed as part of a classroom assignment for the Analog Circuits course at IIT Guwahati, with specifications requiring a DC gain ≥ 40 dB and implementation of a non-inverting amplifier with gain = 2.  
## OBJECTIVE:
  *** To design a two-stage operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) in TSMC180nm CMOS technology<br/>
  *** Ensure a minimum DC gain of 40 dB.
  *** Use the OTA in a non-inverting amplifier configuration with closed-loop gain = 2.
## Technologies & Tools used:
*LTspice for circuit simulation
*and calculations for transistor sizing and biasing
*MOSFET small-signal analysis.
