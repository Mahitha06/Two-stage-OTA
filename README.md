# Two-stage-OTA
This project involves the hand-design, simulation, and analysis of a two-stage OTA using CMOS technology. It was developed as part of a classroom assignment for the Analog Circuits course at IIT Guwahati, with specifications requiring a DC gain ≥ 40 dB and implementation of a non-inverting amplifier with gain = 2.
